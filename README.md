### About

Web3Vendly revolutionizes vending by bringing it into the Web3 ecosystem. Our crypto-powered smart vending machines enable seamless purchase of both digital and physical assetsâ€”leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, traceability, and new levels of personalization.

Traditional vending machines are outdated:

- ðŸ”´ Limited payment options â€” no crypto or stablecoin acceptance  
- ðŸ”´ No integration with NFTs, tokens, or blockchain  
- ðŸ”´ Lack of transparency and traceability  
- ðŸ”´ No personalized or token-gated experiences

2. Selects an item or NFT to purchase

5. Transaction is recorded on-chain for full transparency
