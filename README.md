### About

Web3Vendly revolutionizes vending by bringing it into the Web3 ecosystem. Our crypto-powered smart vending machines enable seamless purchase of both digital and physical assets—leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, traceability, and new levels of personalization.

Traditional vending machines are outdated:

🔴 Limited payment options — no crypto or stablecoin acceptance  
🔴 No integration with NFTs, tokens, or blockchain  
🔴 Lack of transparency and traceability  
🔴 No personalized or token-gated experiences  

---

### How It Works

1. User connects their wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect)  
2. Selects an item or NFT to purchase  
3. Pays securely via PayFi on Shardeum  
4. Receives the item dispensed or NFT minted  
5. Transaction is recorded on-chain for full transparency

### Use Cases

- Token-gated merchandise and rewards

### Market Opportunity
